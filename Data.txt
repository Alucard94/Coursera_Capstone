Data

To help Abigail in her search we will need to access following data:

- The districts of Lima Metropolitana, Peru from Wikipedia: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Distritos_de_Lima

- The coordinates (latitude, longitude) ot these districts of Lima from Open Street Map APIs

- From Foursquare we will need the following venues data:
  - the restaurants venues of the Localities
  - the offices venues of the Localities
  - the high schools venues of the Localities
  - the universities venues of the Localities  

We will then leverage the data in order to determine which locality is the most appropriate in order to locate the new restaurant.
